# I love ICMP
filter all ICMP replies only 

```
icmp.type == 0
```

look at the data fields of each reply


Why Hide Data in ICMP?
1. ICMP is often allowed through firewalls
Many firewalls block unknown TCP/UDP ports, but allow ICMP (e.g. for ping) to check connectivity.
This makes it a sneaky exfiltration channel.

2. ICMP has a flexible payload field
Echo Request and Echo Reply packets can carry arbitrary data in their payload (data) field.
That data isn’t parsed by routers — so it can carry anything: text, Base64, commands, etc.

3. Low suspicion
ICMP traffic is normally considered harmless
A few dozen ping packets might not raise any red flags during casual inspection
