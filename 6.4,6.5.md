# RSA
RSA is a widely used public-key cryptography algorithm that allows secure data encryption, decryption, and digital signatures. Itâ€™s named after its inventors: Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman.

Core Idea
RSA relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.

## RSA signing
Sender signs using private key

## RSA verification
Receiver verifies using public key
