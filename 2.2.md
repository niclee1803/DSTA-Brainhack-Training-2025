# Reversed Hidden Flag
```file_1.txt``` and ```file_2.txt``` contains segments of the flag but in reversed order. I piped the ```rev``` command to reverse the output.
```bash
cat file_1.txt | rev
```

```file_3.txt``` is a symbolic link and I had to navigate to the directory where the original file was to access its contents.
