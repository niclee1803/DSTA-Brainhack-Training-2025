# My startup program
A part of registry file has been converted to a text file.
I hear that a startup program is configured.
Do you mind looking for it?


Search the ```REGISTRY.txt``` file for ```CurrentVersion\Run```

Look at the line below

```
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run]
"Imadeit"="C:\\Program Files (x86)\\HeHe\\W3ll_d0n3_Y0u_F0un[)_17.exe"
```

This program runs every time the user logs in, silently.

Concept: 
Windows Registry stores configuration settings, including instructions on what programs should launch automatically when a user logs in.
The key:
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```
is specifically designed by Windows to be a place where programs can register persistent, user-specific startup behavior.
