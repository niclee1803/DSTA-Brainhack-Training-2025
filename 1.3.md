The file is in binary strings separated by spaces. We need to convert it to ASCII text and save output to a file.
```bash
( tr ' ' '\n' < binary.txt | while read b; do printf "%b" "$(printf '\\x%02x' "$((2#$b))")"; done; echo ) > output.txt
```

Search file for flag containing cddc
```bash
strings output.txt | grep -i "cddc"
```
