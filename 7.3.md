Site tell us that its already flagged, the Flag is Set or Stored in a Cookie
Open Devtools (F12) under Cookies in Application/Storage tab

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client (your browser) by a website to remember information between requests. They're commonly used in CTF web challenges to manage authentication, flags, or user roles, and understanding them is often key to solving such challenges.

🍪 Basics of Cookies:
Stored as name=value pairs.

Sent with every HTTP request to the same origin.

You can view and edit them in the browser's Developer Tools → Application → Cookies.

📌 Common Use Cases:
Purpose	Example
Session management	sessionid=abc123
Authentication	auth=eyJhbGci... (JWT)
User roles	isAdmin=false
Tracking state	visited=true, flag=shown

🛠️ In a CTF Context:
You may be able to decode, edit, or spoof cookies:

Toggle a boolean (isAdmin=false → true)

Decode Base64 strings in cookies for hidden flags

Bypass flag restrictions (e.g., if a cookie says "flag already shown")

Example (in DevTools Console):
```javascript
document.cookie = "isAdmin=true";
```

Example (Base64 decode):
```javascript
atob("Q0REQzIwMjV7Y29va2llX2ZsYWd9");  // → "CDDC2025{cookie_flag}"
```

🧠 Security Note:
Cookies can be:
* HttpOnly (not accessible via JavaScript)
* Secure (only sent over HTTPS)
* Signed (with HMAC or JWT) to prevent tampering
