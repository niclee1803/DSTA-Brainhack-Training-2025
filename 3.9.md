# Excel Hidden flag
Its a .xlsx file, not .xlsm, so no hidden macros

Unzip the excel file
```bash
unzip excel_hidden_flag.xlsx -d xlsx_unzipped
cd xlsx_unzipped
```

Do a search inside the zip for the contents
```bash
grep -i "cddc" -r
```

```-r```: recursive: search through all files and subdirectories




The flag was hidden inside a comment in xl/sharedStrings.xml, which is part of the internal structure of the .xlsx file.

Hereâ€™s what happened:
.xlsx files are ZIP archives with XML content.
sharedStrings.xml stores all string values used in cells.
The flag was embedded in an XML comment:
```xml
<!--  Congratulation! flag is CDDC2025{3xcEl_H1dden_fl4g}  -->
```


An .xlsx file is actually a ZIP archive that contains a structured set of XML files, following the Open XML standard.
