# Many pages in a web app each containing a letter
Write a bash script to get using curl
```bash
for i in {1..102}; do 
  resp=$(curl -s "http://52.76.13.43:8138/page/$i")
  if [[ "$resp" != *"Here is nothing for you"* ]]; then
    echo -n "$resp"
  fi
done
echo
```
skips every page that says Here is nothing for you
