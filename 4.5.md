# Telnet
Telnet is an application-layer protocol (TCP port 23) that allows remote terminal access to a server or device.
It provides a text-based command interface.
But it is not safe - all data, including usernames and passwords are stored in plaintext

Filter for telnet, and check data field of each packet.

SSH is safer than telnet
