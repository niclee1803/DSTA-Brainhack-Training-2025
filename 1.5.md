# Zip file
I get info about the zip file encryption:
```bash
zipinfo -v hohoho.zip
```

```v```: verbose format

turns out the ```hmm.txt``` file is encrypted

Then I use ````fcrackzip``` and a ```rockyou.txt``` which is a list of common passwords, perform a **dictionary attack** on the zip file
```bash
fcrackzip -u -v -D -p rockyou.txt hohoho.zip
```
| Flag             | What it does                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-u`             | Test the password by actually **unzip-ping** the file to check if it's correct  |
| `-v`             | **Verbose** — prints detailed status of what it’s doing                         |
| `-D`             | Use a **dictionary attack** (instead of brute force)                            |
| `-p rockyou.txt` | Path to the **password list** to try                                            |
| `hohoho.zip`     | The **target ZIP file** to crack                                                |
