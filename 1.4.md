Concept: Stenography
Steganography is the practice of hiding data inside other files in a way that’s not obvious to the user.
```steghide``` is a tool that lets you embed and extract hidden data in supported file types like:
```-sf```: stego file
Steghide typically hides data in the least significant bits (LSB) of pixels or sound samples — areas that the human eye or ear can't easily detect a difference.
This lets it store hidden data without noticeably altering the file.
